# Madrid-AirBnB-Analysis
This is Exploratory Analysis about the Madrid lisings in AirBnB. The idea is of this project is to withdraw insight from a dataset supplied by Inside Airbnb. This project uses CRISP-DM structure.

The motivation of this project is to know further about AirBnB phenomenon in Madrid as It has drastically changeed the accomodation bussines in the city and itis being controversial. The more information there is, the better the conflicts can be resolved

This project was used for the Data Scientis Nanodegree (UDACITY)

# Questions to be answered

**Question 1:** Which neighbourhood is the most expensive in terms of renting price?

The data says that the most expensive neighbourhood is Salamanca where are the most exclusives shops and boutiques

**Question 2:** Is Airbnb Madrid used mainly by owners or people managing apartments?

Although AirBnB was born with the idea of helping people to rent their homes/rooms we see that a very high percentage of homes are managed by professional companies

**Question 3:** How well can we predict the renting price? What aspects correlate well to price?

I have made some model however the performace is not good so far. It is open to create new models or to improve the actual ones to achive better efficiency
